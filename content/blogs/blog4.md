description: I come from Plumtree, a small town in Zimbabwe. I studied Finance with Accounting Minor at Solusi University and went on to sit for CFA Level One soon after graduation.  During my undergraduate term, I was part of my school’s CFA Equity Research Challenge Team. We researched on a Zimbabwean-domiciled business operating in the aquaculture industry and presented an investment recommendation before a panel of judges.  My first post-graduation job was in Alternative Investments before which I had worked in the NPO sector while studying simultaneously.  I also worked in an agricultural engineering company where I helped create financial products for its clients.  During this time I volunteered at a local home-school where I had a fulfilling time learning and reflecting with young learners.  I would like to work in Investment Management spaces where I can contribute to improving the livelihoods of many after completing the Masters programme at LBS.
