description: I come from Plumtree, a small town in Zimbabwe. I studied Finance with Accounting Minor at Solusi University and was part of my school’s CFA Equity Research Challenge Team. We researched on a Zimbabwean-domiciled business operating in the aquaculture industry and presented an investment recommendation before a panel of judges. I worked in Alternative Investments, NPOs and agricultural engineering and have volunteered at a local home-school. I would like to work in Investment Management where I can contribute to improving the livelihoods after completing the Masters programme at LBS.

## Bio

Name: Sibusisiwe (Busie) Dhlodhlo

Class: MFA 2022

Target industry: Investment Management/Development Finance

Busie is a female Zimbabwean student at London Business School. She did her undergraduate studies at Solusi University during which period she interned with an NPO. She had also been a pioneer participant in Zimbabwe's first CFA Equity Research Challenge, where her team came second ahead of the rest of Zimbabwean participating institutions of higher learning before she went into Alternative Investments practice. She then left to work for Zimbabwe’s largest agricultural engineering manufacturer where she had an opportunity to volunteer at a local home school. Busie hopes to transition into the first world Investments Industry where she can have a richer experience making things happen.
