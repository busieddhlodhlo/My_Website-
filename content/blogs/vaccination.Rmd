# Challenge 1: Replicating a chart

The purpose of this exercise is to reproduce a plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills. Read the article [The Racial Factor: There's 77 Counties Which Are Deep Blue But Also Low-Vaxx. Guess What They Have In Common?](https://acasignups.net/21/07/18/racial-factor-theres-77-counties-which-are-deep-blue-also-low-vaxx-guess-what-they-have) and have a look at the attached figure.

## Counties with 0s
Some counties have reported a 0% vaccination rate. As these areas tend to be in highly republican and rural areas, the most probable reason for a reported 0% vaccination rate is not that no one there is vaccinated, but rather that there is little to no reporting done there vis-a-vis vaccination statistics. These areas tend to distrust federal oversight and government intervention at many levels and thus either the denizens of said areas would be unlikely to provide the relevant information to outside parties or lack the infrastructure to accurately collect it.
